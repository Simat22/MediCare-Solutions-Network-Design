# MediCare-Solutions-Network-Design
In this project, a network infrastructure was designed and implemented for a MediCare Solutions. The objective is to establish a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), and a dedicated Server-Side site within the headquarters premises. 
The network infrastucture created upholds the principles of the CIA triad while being cost-effective.
Core routers specifically purchased for the headquarters will be used for security and efficiency, these routers will connect to separate Internet Service Providers.
To maintain security and optimize network performance, each department within the headquarters operates on a distinct network segment within the local area network. 
My role and responsibily as a hired network security engineer was to design a robust network model that facilitates seamless communication among the different departments while safeguarding the CIA triad of crucial data and services within the headquarters.
This project's network infrastructure was designed using Cisco Packet Tracer.
